Had a tech phone screen with amazon.
Create a function that will handle language change for every texts in the dom (e.g english to spanish) when clicked on a button.

Had to ask clarifying questions and expectations and etc to narrow down the scope

Technical Phone screening FEE:
Behaviour questions

// Output? Fix it!
var doSomething = function(){
  function a(){
    let c = '2';
  }
  function b(){
    a()
    console.log(c)
  }
  b()
}

// Output? Why? Difference between arrow function and regular function definition
const Shape = (x, y) => {
  this.x = x;
  this.y = y;
};

const myShape = new Shape(4, 5);

console.log(`${myShape.x}, ${myShape.y}`);


CSS selectors
select <p> with id
select first child

Solve using HTML, CSS:
inner to the middle
hovering on outer makes inner to disappear
<div class="outer">
  <div class="inner"><div>
<div>




implement deeplFlattening:
var deepFlatten = function(arr, result){

    arr.forEach(el=>{
        if(Array.isArray(el)){
            deepFlatten(el, result);
        }else{
            result.push(el);
        }
    })

    return result;
}
